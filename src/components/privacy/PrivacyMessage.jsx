            these third parties to enter into a contract with us that requires
            them to use the Personal Information we transfer to them in a manner
            that is consistent with this policy. This data is processed in
            accordance with consent and third-party data processing contract
            requirements under extant data protection laws.

            liquidation, reorganization, or acquisition. In that event, any
            acquirer will be subject to our obligations under this Privacy
