            How it works & how it helps users improve business performance:
          </h6>
          <p>
            With the mobile app downloaded, Buyers (Filling stations) are able
            to <strong>raise quote requests</strong> and{' '}
            <strong>find the best prices </strong> 
            from suppliers around them. While Sellers (Product Depot traders)
            are able to <strong>quickly find buyers</strong> for their product,
            by receiving and responding to quote requests through the platform.{' '}
          </p>
          <p>
            In general,{' '}
            <strong>the platform helps traders find suitable deals,</strong>{' '}
            raise loans quickly, find low price offers and ultimately prevent
            fraud - since payment is required from the buyer upfront and
            remitted by the platform to the seller only upon confirmation of
            product delivery.{' '}

          <h6>Task: </h6>
          <p>
            Put together a <strong>2-page summary document</strong> on how to
            rapidly create awareness within target users and help put the
            business tool (TradeGrid App) in the hands of as many product
            traders as possible, helping them understand how to navigate the
            tool to perform simple tasks like making a purchase (or Sale),
            requesting a loan etc.

            (2) Sellers – I.e. Depots traders. Your submitted strategy should
