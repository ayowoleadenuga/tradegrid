            However, we will not do so if this would compromise our reasonable
            security measures or if it is unlawful to do this. Occasionally, we
            may not be able to contact you to give you advance notice. If you
            have entered incorrect log on details on the Mobile Application on
            several occasions, we will suspend your access to the Mobile

            within the Mobile Application by identifying yourself and answering
            our security questions. Otherwise, you will need to call us on our

            Our failure to enforce these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of
            these terms, and such failure shall not affect the right later to
            enforce these Terms. We would still be entitled to exercise our
            rights in any other situation where you breach these Terms.

          <h5>Rights of Third Parties</h5>
          <p>
            A person or entity who is not a party to these Terms shall have no
            right to enforce any provision of these Terms, regardless of whether
            such person or entity has been identified by name, as a member of a
            class or as answering a particular description. For the avoidance of
            doubt, nothing in this Paragraph shall affect the rights of any
            permitted assignee or transferee of these Terms.

            All rights and restrictions contained in this Agreement may be
            exercised and shall be applicable and binding only to the extent
            that they do not violate any applicable laws and are intended to be
            limited to the extent necessary so that they will not render this
            Agreement illegal, invalid or unenforceable. If any provision or
            portion of any provision of this Agreement shall be held to be
            illegal, invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent
            jurisdiction, it is the intention of the parties that the remaining
            provisions or portions thereof shall constitute their agreement with
            respect to the subject matter hereof, and all such remaining
            provisions or portions thereof shall remain in full force and
            effect.

          <p>
            The validity, construction and performance of this Agreement shall
            be governed by the laws of the State of California. Parties shall
            use their best endeavors to amicably settle any dispute or
            difference of opinion arising from or in connection with this
            Agreement through mutual discussions in line with our Dispute
            Resolution and Complaint Management Control Framework.

            All disputes should be logged formally by sending an email to
            support@thetradegrid.com within 90 days of the transaction date.
            Where the Parties are unable to resolve the dispute through mutual
            discussions, the dispute or difference of opinion shall be referred
            to mediation conducted by their legal representatives or financial
            auditors, where financial matters are involved. Failing which the
            dispute shall finally be referred to arbitration in accordance with
            the Laws of the State of California, or any amendment thereto.
          </p>
          <p>
            The place of arbitration shall be where the Complainant is resident
            and there shall be a sole arbitrator who shall be appointed jointly
            by the parties. The language to be used in the arbitral proceedings
            shall be English. The arbitral award shall be final and binding
            between the Parties. The reference of any dispute to arbitration
            shall not prevent the Parties from seeking any form of protective
            reliefs/injunctions/specific performance from a court of law via
            motion or other originating processes for the protection of any res
            pending the constitution of the Arbitral Panel and/or final award.
