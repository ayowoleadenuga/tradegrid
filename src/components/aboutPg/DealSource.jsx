                TradeGrid’s price discovery method ensures buyers have instant
                access to the best possible prices, at all times. It achieves
                this by combining 2 proprietary technologies – The Integrated
                Autonomous Bidding Agent (ABA) - allowing Sellers participate in
                an almost infinite number of simultaneous bids at lightning
                speed - and The Quote Broadcast & Rank (QBR) technology - a
                multivariate bid processing technology with capacity to request
                and process thousands of bids per second.

              <p>
                While our platforms are built to be extremely user-friendly, we
                have developed a straight-forward verification protocol to
                ensure all verified users are traceable, authentic and with the
                right level of product liability insurance. This allows
                transacting parties on the platform carry on without risk of
                potential fraud.

              <p>
                For 3rd parties such as financiers and insurers, the platform
                assists with authenticating and verifying the validity of trade
                deals, minimizing the risk of loan defaults, and potentially
                allowing for more friendly financing terms.
